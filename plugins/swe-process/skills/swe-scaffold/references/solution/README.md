# [SOLUTION_NAME]

[ONE_PARAGRAPH_SOLUTION_PURPOSE_AND_BOUNDARY]

This repository implements one Solution within a portfolio. The upstream portfolio defines Epics, Concepts, platform contracts, and canonical Features. This repository owns Solution, Package, and Module architecture plus Design, code, tests, and delivery evidence.

## Start Here

- [Agent governance](./AGENTS.md)
- [Solution architecture](./architecture/README.md)
- [Implementation work](./.swe/README.md)
- [Context vocabulary](./CONTEXT.md) (replace with a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` only when the Solution expands to multiple bounded contexts)
- [Version](./VERSION.md)

## Delivery Model

```text
upstream canonical Feature
  -> upstream portfolio Implementation Plan
  -> accepted local architecture and Design
  -> code, tests, and EVIDENCE
  -> local VALIDATION
  -> architecture reconciliation and upstream handoff
```

Every implementation scope retains dual locators for the upstream Feature and its portfolio-owned Implementation Plan. A local artifact may refine implementation, but it does not copy or redefine upstream intent or allocation.

## Extending This Scaffold

Replace bracketed placeholders in [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md) and repository documentation, then register the upstream portfolio Feature and Plan in implementation artifacts. If the Solution later expands to multiple bounded contexts, follow the migration contract in `CONTEXT.md`: preserve its stable ID under `.swe/context/`, create a distinct root `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, and use the map as the sole root entry point. Preserve the layout and approval rules in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md); add narrower `AGENTS.md` files only when a subtree needs durable additional governance.
