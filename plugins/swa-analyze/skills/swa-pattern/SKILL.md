description: Extract recurring structural patterns from existing software artifacts and code, evaluate their fitness, and recommend a more coherent architecture pattern language. Use when similar configurations recur inconsistently or repeatedly cause the same design problem. Do not refactor code or artifacts.

# Pattern-Language Analysis

Turn repeated architectural structures into an explicit, evidence-backed pattern language and replace unfit repetition with better forms.

## Analyze

1. Resolve the exact repository target and existing SWE artifact chain with [the shared analysis contract](../swa-analyze/references/ANALYSIS-CONTRACT.md).
2. Read [the strategy guide](references/STRATEGY.md) and apply its questions to the documented and implemented architecture.
3. Gather structural code evidence with [the Codebase Memory workflow](../swa-analyze/references/CODEBASE-MEMORY.md), then verify material claims against direct source and non-code artifacts.
4. Develop prioritized architectural recommendations with explicit evidence, affected authority, expected effect, trade-offs, migration implications, and validation tests.

## Output

- On a direct or autonomous invocation, create `architecture/analysis/<scope-key>/ANALYSIS.md` and return its repository-relative path to the calling agent.
- When `$swa-analyze` selects this skill in contribution mode, return structured findings, recommendations, evidence, assumptions, and limitations to the router; do not write a separate report.
- Never overwrite an existing report without explicit user authorization. Never modify analyzed code or authoritative artifacts.
