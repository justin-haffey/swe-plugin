description: Analyze the metaphors and mental models embedded in existing software artifacts, test how they constrain architecture, and propose more generative replacements. Use when terms such as pipeline, machine, platform, graph, or ecosystem appear to dictate the design. Do not rewrite artifacts or code.

# Metaphor Replacement

Reveal the governing metaphors behind the current design and test whether a different mental model unlocks a better architecture.

## Analyze

1. Resolve the exact repository target and existing SWE artifact chain with [the shared analysis contract](../swa-analyze/references/ANALYSIS-CONTRACT.md).
2. Read [the strategy guide](references/STRATEGY.md) and apply its questions to the documented and implemented architecture.
3. Gather structural code evidence with [the Codebase Memory workflow](../swa-analyze/references/CODEBASE-MEMORY.md), then verify material claims against direct source and non-code artifacts.
4. Develop prioritized architectural recommendations with explicit evidence, affected authority, expected effect, trade-offs, migration implications, and validation tests.

## Output

- On a direct or autonomous invocation, create `architecture/analysis/<scope-key>/ANALYSIS.md` and return its repository-relative path to the calling agent.
- When `$swa-analyze` selects this skill in contribution mode, return structured findings, recommendations, evidence, assumptions, and limitations to the router; do not write a separate report.
- Never overwrite an existing report without explicit user authorization. Never modify analyzed code or authoritative artifacts.
